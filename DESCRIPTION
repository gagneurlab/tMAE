Title: Tests and visualizes for Mono-allelic expressed variants
Version: 1.0.1
Authors@R: c(
    person(given = "Vicente",
           family = "Yepez",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "yepez@in.tum.de"),

Description: Given allele-specific counts generated by GATK, tests for 
    mono-allelic expression using DESeq. It also adds allele frequency from
    gnomAD and provides plotting functions for visualization.
